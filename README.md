## Supermarket checkout

A supermarket sells the following items:

| Item | Price |
| ---- | ----- |
| A    | £50   |
| B    | £30   |
| C    | £20   |

In addition, the supermarket offers some discounts:

- 2 items A for £90
- 3 items B for £75
- 10% off total basket cost for baskets worth over £200 (after previous discounts)

You must write a solution using JS which is used like this:

```js
const checkout = new Checkout(pricing_rules);
checkout.scan(item);
checkout.scan(item);
const price = checkout.total;
```

Here are some examples:

| Items               | Basket total |
| ------------------- | ------------ |
| A, B, C             | £100         |
| B, A, B, B, A       | £165         |
| C, B, A, A, C, B, C | £189         |

When designing your solution keep in mind that a supermarket might want to add new discounts in the future. What programming principle(s) should you follow to make the process of adding new discounts as straightforward as possible? Say a new developer takes over from where you left off, and the supermarket needs to make some changes to the system, what (in terms of code design) would best set this new developer up to succeed? Your design should reflect how you would answer these sorts of questions.

Write tests to make sure your code works. Commit often so we can follow the decisions you made. Unless you have a very good reason to incorporate rails, a db, or provide a cli, please focus on a PORO solution.
